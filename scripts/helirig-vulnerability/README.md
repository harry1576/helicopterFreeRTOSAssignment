# Security Issues
A simple test script to verify the vulnerability of the HeliViewer has been created, with two different options, the first
is a simple Rick Roll where the users view of the helicopter is exchanged to the YouTube video. The second is to kick a user from
the HeliRig, this simply kicks the user by printing `<script>finishSession();</script>` into the serial terminal.

# This is not to be used maliciously

## Usage
To remote into the University network and bind `localhost:3333` to port `:3333` of the rig use ssh, the bash script `remote-connect`
has be created to do this.

```console
user@linux:~$ ./remote-connect [rig_number] [uoc_user_id]
```

To run the script use:
```
./run-gdb -s [script_name] 
```

At the moment the only scripts are `kick` and `rick-roll`
